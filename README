This plugin provides Spotify integration for Rhythmbox

It is based (99%) on https://github.com/ivankelly/Rhythmbox-Spotify-Plugin/ by
Ivan Kelly.
This is merely a port of it to the out-of-tree plugin building added recently
to Rhythmbox and a port to the newer APIs.

It currently provides Search and playing, with playlist importation to come soon.
